## Mathew E. Thompson
### Engineering Manager and Developer

I am a software engineering manager and developer. I reside in the Chicago Area. I have been tinkering with and writing software for the majority of my life. I currently manage mobile and web application projects.

My current interests include fitness, motorcycles and drawing.

I am always looking for an opportunity to lead and mentor other developers.

I am also looking for fun open source projects to collaborate on.
